# Welcome to the Inifinity Stones Collector!
## You will be given a random number at the start of the game. Try to use the Infinity Stones to match your points to that very number! The 4 stones you have are Power, Reality, Mind, and Time. The Number Value tied to each stone is random, and changes every game. You'll have to figure them out on your own!

## Match your points to the random number to save the Galaxy. If you go over, Thanos wins, and you lose!
